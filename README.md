 ## Core Deliverables
 As a user, I can:

See the first movie's details, including its poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets when the page loads. The number of available tickets will need to be derived by subtracting the number of tickets_sold from the theater's capacity. You will need to make a GET request to the following endpoint to retrieve the film data: GET /films/1

See a menu of all movies on the left side of the page in the ul#films element when the page loads. (optional: you can style each film in the list by adding the classes film item to each li element.) There is a placeholder li in the ul#films element that is hardcoded in the HTML â€” feel free to remove that element by editing the HTML file directly, or use JavaScript to remove the placeholder element before populating the list. You will need to make a GET request to the following endpoint to retrieve the film data:

GET /films

Example response: [ { "id": "1", "title": "The Giant Gila Monster", "runtime": "108", "capacity": 30, "showtime": "04:00PM", "tickets_sold": 27, "description": "A giant lizard terrorizes a rural Texas community and a heroic teenager attempts to destroy the creature.", "poster": "https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/2157/p2157_v_v8_ab.jpg" }, { "id": "2", "title": "Manos: The Hands Of Fate", "runtime": "118", "capacity": 50, "showtime": "06:45PM", "tickets_sold": 44, "description": "A family gets lost on the road and stumbles upon a hidden, underground, devil-worshiping cult led by the fearsome Master and his servant Torgo.", "poster": "https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/v22vodart/47781/p47781_v_v8_ac.jpg" } ] 3. Buy a ticket for a movie. After clicking the "Buy Ticket" button, I should see the number of available tickets decreasing on the frontend. I should not be able to buy a ticket if the showing is sold out (if there are 0 tickets available). No persistence is needed for this feature.
